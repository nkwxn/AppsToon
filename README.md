# AppsToon
This is a project that I did on my 2nd semester on Business Application Development Course, which is built using the Eclipse Java IDE and MySQL as a Database.
This application will not run properly if there is no MySQL PhpMyAdmin + the database file installed
Link to the SQL file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BuRFR3WpxwiI_C47uuO9WrQ1EfVhUWQk/view?usp=sharing
To make the app work with the database, open localhost/phpmyadmin, click import -> browse file -> attach the sql file from the google drive link and click Go
